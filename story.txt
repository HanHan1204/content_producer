There was once a yellow bird, David, who was lost in the yard and was trying to find his mother. “Where is my mother? I need to find her!”, said David.

David flew to a desert and met a white bird, Alex. "Do you know where is my mother?", said David. "I think she is in the castle", said Alex.

David flew to a castle and was blocked by a blue bird, Ben.  "I want to find my mother, do you know where she is?", said David. "You are not allowed to be here! She's not here, go away!", said Ben.

David sadly flew to a volcano. "It is so hot here, mother cannot be here, maybe she is thirsty?", said David.

And so David flew across the lagoon and saw a familiar figure. "Mom! Is that you?", said David. "Hey son, I was collecting water for you. Come, lets go home!", said Wendy.

And they flew back to the garden and live happily ever after. “I love you, mom!”, said David. “You are my darling!”, said Wendy.
